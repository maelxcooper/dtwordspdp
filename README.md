# HTML NBSP Inserter Tool

This small web tool is designed to assist me with my work at **Datawords**.  
It processes HTML input to automatically add non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) after all 1- to 3-letter words inside heading tags (`h1`â€“`h6`), paragraph tags (`p`), anchor tags (`a`), and span tags (`span`). This helps improve typography consistency and readability.

## Features

- Preserves the original HTML structure and attributes.
- Processes multiple blocks of HTML code in bulk.
- Outputs the processed HTML in a separate box for easy copying.
- Includes buttons to process, copy, and clear the input/output.
- Alerts the user if no input text is provided.
- Maintains XHTML-style self-closing tags on `<img>` and `<source>` elements.

## Usage

Open the hosted HTML file in your browser, paste your HTML code into the input box, and click **Process HTML**. The output will appear in the box below, ready to copy or clear.
